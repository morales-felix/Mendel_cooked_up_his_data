# Mendel_cooked_up_his_data  
In construction...  
  
  In essence, this is an extract from a class project in which we explored the notion that Mendel cooked up his data so it appeared impressive on his paper on pea hybridization (something that I imagine most of us learned during high school biology, dominant and recessive alleles, etc.). The summary is that Mendel's laws can be framed as Chi-square distributions. If one assumes this, and then overlays Mendel's data on top of this distribution, one can see how Mendel's data has the tails of the distribution missing. Why?
