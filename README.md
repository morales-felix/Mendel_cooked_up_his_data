# Mendel Cooked Up His Data?

This repository contains a fun exploration from a class project investigating the theory that Gregor Mendel may have manipulated his data on pea hybridization to appear more impressive. This is the same Mendel whose laws of inheritance most of us learned in high school biology, dealing with dominant and recessive alleles.  

### What's the Project About?  

Mendel's laws can be expressed as Chi-square distributions. By overlaying Mendel's data onto this distribution, we notice something intriguing: the tails of the distribution are missing in Mendel's results. Why might that be?
